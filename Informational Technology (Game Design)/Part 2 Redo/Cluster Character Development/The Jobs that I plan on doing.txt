Antique Hoop


AT1: Main Character/Player
From Job: MegaMurder
Character Chosen: Mk1 Combat Droid
Description:
- Humanoid combat robot
- Head resembles some kind of camera
- Strong resemblance to a ‘skinny’ Boston 
Dynamics robot
- Armour plating across the torso and 
upper thighs, with only a little bit of 
armour on the rest of the limbs
- Limited jetpack/boost assembly on the 
back which can almost give the 
appearance of wings

AT2: Enemy Character
From Job: Antique Hoop
Character Chosen: Possessed Armour
Description:
- Literally just a suit of armour filled with a 
formless mist
- The armour is impeccable and shiny, 
except for near the joints where the mist 
filling it occasionally leaks out
- Wields a large two handed axe

AT2 alternitve: Enemy Character
From Job: MegaMurder
Character Chosen: Mk2 Combat Droid
Description:
- Literally Mk1 with a palette flipped 
colour scheme 
- Slight improvements on the ‘base’ model; 
head might resemble a slightly better 
model of camera
- Left arm is slightly bulkier in order to 
contain a unique weapon system & needs 
to be detachable (essentially a prop for 
the main model) as it serves as a pickup 
for the player after they defeat Mk2

AT3: NPC Character
From Job: Antique Hoop
Character Chosen: Level Up NPC
Description:
- Feminine humanoid
- Appears to be either a teenager or very 
young adult
- Not strictly speaking a human – has some 
kind of mystical property, or is maybe a 
demigod?
- Long hair styled meticulously before 
being hidden by a hood
- Conservative/modest clothing made from 
a rich material, slightly tarnished by time 
and travel
- Their clothes almost entirely hide their 
form
- Reserved and soft spoken, seemingly 
subservient but ultimately holds 
significant power over the Chosen 
Unburnished as they grant them power
