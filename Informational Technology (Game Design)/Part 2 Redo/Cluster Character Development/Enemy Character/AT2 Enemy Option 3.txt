AT2 alternitve: Enemy Character
From Job: MegaMurder
Character Chosen: Mk2 Combat Droid
Description:
- Literally Mk1 with a palette flipped 
colour scheme 
- Slight improvements on the ‘base’ model; 
head might resemble a slightly better 
model of camera
- Left arm is slightly bulkier in order to 
contain a unique weapon system & needs 
to be detachable (essentially a prop for 
the main model) as it serves as a pickup 
for the player after they defeat Mk2
