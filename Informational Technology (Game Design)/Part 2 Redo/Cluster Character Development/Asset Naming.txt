I will name the character assets like this:
<character/name_of_character>_V<what ever I want the version number to be>
e.g. Mk1_Combat_Droid_V0.1

the version(V) number will increment each session I work on the model (It will only be the decimal number though)
Once the model is considered done it's version number will be V1
